		<h2> Welcome to my Personal page, a little bit about me!</H2>
		
		<p>Well what can I say? Darth Vader and Batman are my main homies. I am the oldest of three kids, (two younger, much bigger brothers!) I like to consider myself a Jane of all trades! I can't ever dedicate myself to strictly one hobby or anything really for that matter! </p>
		 <p> 
		 <p> I have a little chihuahua mix that I rescued. My partner in crime, Tank!</p>
